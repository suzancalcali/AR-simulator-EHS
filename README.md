Ready-to-use AR simulators for Health and Safety Training 

Project overview:
Agumently is an augmented reality simulator that provides health and safety training. It educates individuals on environmental, health, and safety issues, with the goal of promoting safe work practices and protecting workers and the environment. It uses a safety procedure called lock-out/tag-out (Loto) that involves placing physical locks or tags on equipment to prevent accidental or unintended startup or release of hazardous energy during maintenance or repair. Agumently, built in Unity, is more interactive and customizable than traditional health and safety training programs and includes features such as sound activation, interaction with augmented reality machinery, and the ability to complete tasks with button clicks. It aims to be a more effective and efficient way to learn about health and safety practices.

Installation instructions
Install Unity:
Unity is a powerful game engine that is used to build and deploy games and interactive content. It is available for free download from the Unity website (https://unity.com/).
Install Vuforia engine:
Vuforia is an AR platform that allows developers to build AR apps and experiences. It is available for free download from the Vuforia website (https://www.vuforia.com/).
Set up an Apple Developer account:
If you want to build and deploy the Agumently app on iOS, you will need to have an Apple Developer account. You can set up an account by visiting the Apple Developer website (https://developer.apple.com/).
Install Xcode:
Xcode is a development environment for building and deploying iOS apps. It is available for free from the Mac App Store (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).
Install the Unity asset store packages:
The Agumently project uses some assets from the Unity Asset Store. To install these assets, you will need to have an account on the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/).
Install Figma:
Figma is a design and prototyping tool that is used to create UI elements for the Agumently app. It is available for free from the Figma website (https://www.figma.com/).

Here is a step-by-step guide for building the Agumently project:

1.Research the problem and target audience: Start by doing research to define the problem that the Agumently project aims to solve, as well as the target audience for the training. This will help you understand the goals and requirements of the project and design the training method accordingly.

2.Create a Figma prototype: Use Figma (https://www.figma.com/) to create a prototype of the Agumently app. This will help you visualize the design and layout of the app and test out different UI elements and interactions.

3.Start building the project in Unity: Once you have a clear idea of the project goals and design, start building the project in Unity (https://unity.com/).

4.Download and install the required assets: Download and install the Vuforia engine (https://www.vuforia.com/) and any other assets that you will need for the project, such as 3D models, audio files, and images. You may also need to set up an account on the Unity Asset Store (https://assetstore.unity.com/) to download certain assets.

5.Set up the project settings: In the Unity editor, go to "Edit > Project Settings" and configure the settings for your project. Make sure to switch the build platform to iOS.

6.Add an AR camera and test the project: Add an AR camera to the scene and test the project by building it to your iOS device. You can use a simple object, such as a cube, to make sure that the AR camera is working correctly.

7.Add 3D objects and a canvas: Add 3D objects, such as machinery, to the scene and create a canvas for the UI elements of the mobile app.

8.Create 3D objects and add image assets: Create any additional 3D objects that you need, such as switch buttons, and add image assets that you created in Figma.

9.Add scripts and build the experience: Use scripts to add interactivity and functionality to the app, such as hiding and showing objects and playing audio clips.

10.Use Xcode as a code editor: If you need to make any changes to the code for the app, you can use Xcode (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) as a code editor.

11.Build and deploy the app: When you are ready to build and deploy the app, go to "File > Build Settings" in the Unity editor and follow the prompts to build and install the app on your iOS device.
